Last april john took a trip to Las Vegas Nevada Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western
portion of the United States the town is most popular for its casinos hotels and exciting nightlife
in downtown Las Vegas John spent a lot of time on the strip which is a twenty five mile stretch of shopping
entertainment venues luxury hotels and fine dining experiences this is probably the most commonly
visited tourist area in the city the strip at night looks especially beautiful all of the buildings light up
with bright neon eyecatching signs to attract visitor attention a stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a
visit to many popular cities worldwide many of the hotels have miniature versions of important
international sites and monuments these famous landmarks include the Eiffel tower Venice and
even ancient Rome
One day John took a side trip outside of the city to visit the Grand Canyon one of the seven wonders
of the natural world the Canyon offers a breathtaking view of Nevadas ridges and natural landscape
John especially liked the canyon because it was removed from all of the noise and movement in
downtown Las Vegas
